  <p id="lci-description">The Last Command Initiative (LCI) is a broad partnership of church planting, scripture engagement,
    language development and Bible translation organisations with a vision to reach all language
    communities with remaining needs. Dependent on God for its success, LCI aims to see that by the
    year 2025 all viable remaining language communities of India will have Bible translation and
    language development-related work started that need it; while by 2035 all will have the Scriptures in
    the languages and forms that communicate to them most effectively, and these Scriptures will be
    having a transforming effect on their lives and communities.</p>
